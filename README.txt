This is the final project from my intro to programming class, CSC 210.

The assignment was to create a chess game that displays the board in real time,
as well as tracking every move to see if it was possible by the rules of chess.

The assignment was clear that it did not require the taking of pieces, because
our professor thought it was beyond our scope at the time. 

My program displays the board every turn in the console, and takes chess coordinates
for the piece location that you wish to move, and coordinates for the desired location 
you wish to move to.  It will display an error if that move is occupied by another piece,
or if the move is impossible to make (I.E. a bishop trying to move from A1 to B1).

It is NOT a fully featured chess app but it is close.  This was my fifth Java project,
and I got a 97/100 on it.
